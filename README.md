This game was made for the [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/) console and can be easily run be uploading to the sprig editor, or by searching through the gallery for "Falldown Mini"!

### Python:
This will allow you to execute all python scripts included:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
I have provided image for the graphic applications:

### Rust:
To run the Rust projects, cd in to the directory and run:
`cargo run`

Sadly none of the projects I made with Rust are graphic projects, and they are all terminal applications instead
